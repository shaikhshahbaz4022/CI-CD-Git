### CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
#### It is a set of practices and tools that are used by software development teams to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software changes.

#### Continuous Integration refers to the process of automatically building and testing code changes whenever they are made. This ensures that new code is integrated with the existing codebase without causing any errors or conflicts. Continuous Deployment refers to the process of automatically deploying code changes to production servers after they have been tested and approved.

### GitHub Actions
#### is a CI/CD tool that is integrated into the GitHub platform. It allows developers to automate their software development workflows by defining custom actions that can be triggered by events, such as code changes, pull requests, or issues.

## GitHub Actions can be used for a variety of tasks:

#### Building and testing code: Developers can use GitHub Actions to automatically build and test their code changes whenever they are made, ensuring that the code is always in a functional state.
#### Deploying applications: Developers can use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy their applications to production servers whenever new code changes are made and tested.
Automating code reviews: Developers can use GitHub Actions to automatically run code review tools, such as linters and style checkers, on their code changes, ensuring that the code meets the team's standards and best practices.
